# VRFinalProject

TODO List:

Wes Feedback:
- Make bullets faster, or make targets stay for longer (because otherwise, you basically have to shoot at the targets immediately when they spawn for the bullets to get there)

- Make Start Menu and End Game Menu
  - End Game menu shows final score and has a reset button
- Make targets spawn in an internal grid (the players can't see the grid, but we have several fixed positions for the targets to randomly spawn in)
- Add minor sound effects
- Add second scene with other cue effect
- Add code to get user data (total score, accuracy, etc.)
